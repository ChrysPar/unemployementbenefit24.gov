Note: the annual family income is considered to be the total annual taxable, actual, exempt, or specially taxed income from all sources—excluding severance pay—of the client, their spouse, and their minor children for the tax year preceding the exercise of the right. For example, for applications submitted in the year 2022, citizens will need to provide a tax assessment notice for the tax year 2020. Unemployment, sickness, maternity, and long-term unemployment benefits (for any disbursement in the following calendar year) are not included in the annual family income. For adult single beneficiaries, the family income is considered to be the individual income."
